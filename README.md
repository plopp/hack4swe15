<h3>Solution description</h3>
The wherenow app is a general pathfinding 
optimality problem solver for arbitrary datasets. Datasets are
added as layers with different brightness on top of Google Maps. 
The app uses A* search internally to calculate the minimum cost
going from point A to point B on the map. With sliders the weight
of each layer can be adjusted and therefore affect the ultimate
solution for the pathfinder. Three different scenarios have been
defined: Forest industry, nature treat and training. Each scenario
weighs the different used datasets differently and achieves different
optimal paths on the map. Some of the used datasets are: roads, 
ancient monuments, water, soil, bedrock, forests etc.
